    description: `This is Prompetition, a competitive creative writing application. There is one writing prompt that everyone can see, and everyone can submit their written work once. During that day, a user can only see their own submission. The next day everyone can vote on yesterday's entries for the one they like the most. At the end of that day, a winner is permanently decided, and this is displayed on their account profile.\n
    At any point afterwards, users can still enter submissions to previous writing prompts, but these post-contest submissions are only for artistic writing, there will not be a new winner. But, users can still "like" these post-contest submissions, and the highest scoring submission is put on display underneath the contest-period winner.\n
    There is also an alternative head-to-head mode where two users are put together and are given the same writing prompt, and a short period of time to write. Once this time is up, the two submissions are voted on by other users.`,
